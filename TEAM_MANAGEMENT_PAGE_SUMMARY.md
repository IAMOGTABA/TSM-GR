INSERT INTO teams (name, description, team_admin_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?)

-- View Teams with Statistics
SELECT t.*, admin_user.full_name as admin_name, 
       COUNT(team_users.id) as member_count,
       COUNT(team_tasks.id) as task_count
FROM teams t
LEFT JOIN users admin_user ON t.team_admin_id = admin_user.id
LEFT JOIN users team_users ON t.id = team_users.team_id
LEFT JOIN tasks team_tasks ON t.id = team_tasks.team_id
GROUP BY t.id

-- Update Team
UPDATE teams SET name = ?, description = ?, team_admin_id = ? WHERE id = ?

-- Delete Team (with safety check)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE team_id = ?
DELETE FROM teams WHERE id = ?
```

### Data Validation
- ✅ Team name uniqueness
- ✅ Team admin role validation
- ✅ User existence and status checks
- ✅ Member count verification before deletion

## 📊 **Team Statistics Display**

Each team shows:
- **Team Name & Description**
- **Assigned Team Admin** (name and email)
- **Member Count** (number of users in team)
- **Task Count** (number of tasks assigned to team)
- **Creation Date** (when team was created)
- **Action Buttons** (Edit/Delete)

## 🔐 **Security Features**

### Access Control

- ✅ Session validation on all pages
- ✅ Role verification for team admin assignments

### Data Protection
- ✅ SQL injection prevention with prepared statements
- ✅ Input sanitization and validation

### Business Logic

- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback

## 🎯 **Navigation Structure**

The navigation now includes:
```
Dashboard
