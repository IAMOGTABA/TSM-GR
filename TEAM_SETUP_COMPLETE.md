## Database Connection
The system uses the existing `config.php` for database connection. Ensure your database credentials are correctly configured.

## Security Considerations
- All passwords are hashed using PHP's `password_hash()`
- Foreign key constraints maintain data integrity
- Role-based access control implemented
- Input validation should be implemented in application layer

## Testing
Test the new functionality by:
1. Logging in as different user types (admin, team_admin, employee)
2. Creating and assigning tasks within teams
3. Testing team messaging
4. Verifying permission restrictions
5. Using task templates
6. Testing notification system

## Support
For issues or questions about the team functionality implementation, refer to:
- `DATABASE.md` for schema details
- Individual setup scripts for specific functionality
- Verification scripts for troubleshooting
