# Edit User - Team Admin Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Implementation Complete**

I have successfully added Team Admin functionality to the `edit-user.php` page with full database integration and dynamic form behavior.

## 🔧 **Changes Made to `edit-user.php`**

### 1. **Enhanced Role Management**
- ✅ Added "Team Admin" option to the role dropdown
- ✅ Role options now include: Admin, Team Admin, Employee
- ✅ Dynamic team selection appears for Team Admin and Employee roles

### 2. **Team Data Loading**
- ✅ Added teams loading from database at page initialization
- ✅ Teams dropdown populated with all available teams
- ✅ Current user's team pre-selected in the dropdown

### 3. **Form Processing Updates**
- ✅ Added `team_id` and `parent_admin_id` to form processing
- ✅ Enhanced validation for role and team assignment
- ✅ Team assignment required for Team Admin and Employee roles
- ✅ Automatic `parent_admin_id` assignment for Team Admins

### 4. **Database Integration**
- ✅ Updated SQL query to include `team_id` and `parent_admin_id`
- ✅ Team existence validation before user update
- ✅ Role validation ensures only valid roles are accepted

### 5. **Team Admin Permissions Management**
- ✅ **Creating Team Admin**: Automatically creates permissions if user becomes Team Admin
- ✅ **Removing Team Admin**: Automatically removes permissions if user role changes from Team Admin
- ✅ **Updating Team Admin**: Checks for existing permissions before creating new ones
- ✅ All permissions set to TRUE by default:
  - `can_assign` - Can assign tasks
  - `can_edit` - Can edit tasks
  - `can_archive` - Can archive tasks
  - `can_add_members` - Can add team members
  - `can_view_reports` - Can view team reports
  - `can_send_messages` - Can send team messages

### 6. **Dynamic UI Behavior**
- ✅ JavaScript `toggleTeamSelection()` function controls team dropdown visibility
- ✅ Team selection appears when Team Admin or Employee is selected
- ✅ Team selection hidden when Admin is selected
- ✅ Form validation ensures required fields are completed

### 7. **Visual Enhancements**
- ✅ Styled team selection section with visual emphasis
- ✅ Helper text explaining when team selection is required
- ✅ Consistent styling with existing form elements
- ✅ Smooth transitions and user-friendly interface

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### Editing to Admin Role
1. Select "Admin" role
2. Team selection automatically hides
3. `team_id` and `parent_admin_id` set to NULL
4. Any existing team admin permissions are removed

### Editing to Team Admin Role
1. Select "Team Admin" role
2. Team selection appears and becomes required
3. Select team from dropdown
4. User updated with:
   - `team_id` set to selected team
   - `parent_admin_id` set to current admin
   - Permissions created in `team_admin_permissions` table (if not exists)

### Editing to Employee Role
1. Select "Employee" role
2. Team selection appears and becomes required
3. Select team from dropdown
4. User updated with `team_id` set to selected team
5. Any existing team admin permissions are removed

## 🔄 **Permission Management Logic**

```php
// When changing TO team_admin
if ($role === 'team_admin' && !empty($team_id)) {
    // Check if permissions exist
    if (no_permissions_exist) {
        // Create full permissions
        INSERT INTO team_admin_permissions (all permissions = TRUE)
    }
}

// When changing FROM team_admin to something else
elseif ($user['role'] === 'team_admin' && $role !== 'team_admin') {
    // Remove all team admin permissions
    DELETE FROM team_admin_permissions WHERE user_id = ?
}
```

## 🗄️ **Database Operations**

### User Update Query
```sql
UPDATE users SET 
    email = ?, 
    full_name = ?, 
    role = ?, 
    status = ?, 
    team_id = ?, 
    parent_admin_id = ? 
WHERE id = ?
```

### Permission Management Queries
```sql
-- Check existing permissions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM team_admin_permissions WHERE user_id = ? AND team_id = ?

-- Create permissions
INSERT INTO team_admin_permissions (user_id, team_id, can_assign, can_edit, can_archive, can_add_members, can_view_reports, can_send_messages) VALUES (?, ?, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)

-- Remove permissions
DELETE FROM team_admin_permissions WHERE user_id = ?
```

## 🎨 **UI Features**

### Form Elements
- **Role Dropdown**: Includes Admin, Team Admin, Employee options
- **Team Selection**: Dynamic dropdown with all available teams
- **Helper Text**: "Required for Team Admin and Employee roles"
